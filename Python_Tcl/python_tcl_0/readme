This exercise is to implement a process where a Tcl script reads commands one by one, 
sends them to a file in the WSL environment, then returns the results to Python3 for file reading and processing, 
so that the information is both recorded in a file and displayed in the terminal.
                                                               
keypoints:
1.Python3 invoke a Tcl file 
2.Python3 save return results to a file and display into terminal
3.Tcl read multiline and sent commands to WSL 
4.Use class to verify the python3_print function to invoke the same Obj:
