OSPF_NEIGHBOR_NOT_FULL:
  description: >
    OSPF neighbor adjacency is not in FULL state based on
    parsed protocol state. This indicates an underlay
    routing adjacency issue.

  actions:
    - show ip ospf neighbor
    - show ip ospf interface

  notes:
    - Issue is triggered when OSPF neighbor state is not FULL
    - YAML does not evaluate OSPF FSM states directly
    - Root cause may relate to interface or underlay connectivity
