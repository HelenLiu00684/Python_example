EVPN_NEIGHBOR_DOWN:
  description: >
    EVPN neighbor session is down based on parsed overlay
    control-plane state. This may impact L2/L3 service
    reachability.

  actions:
    - show bgp evpn summary
    - show bgp evpn neighbors {peer}

  notes:
    - Issue is triggered when EVPN neighbor is not operational
    - YAML does not match EVPN FSM or log output
    - Root cause may reside in underlay routing or interfaces
