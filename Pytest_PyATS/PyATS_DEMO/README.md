## PyATS Network Health Demo
This demo shows a network health validation workflow built with pyATS and Python.
It takes raw device logs and routing summaries, normalizes them into structured, vendor-agnostic data, and runs rule-based checks on interfaces and routing protocols such as OSPF, BGP, and EVPN. The system produces operation suggestions only (YAML output), with no live configuration changes.
The project is intentionally split into clear layers: semantic parsing, protocol checkers, and cross-protocol correlation. Parsers only normalize data, checkers only apply protocol-specific rules, and correlation logic only reasons about dependencies between protocol layers. This separation keeps the behavior deterministic, easy to extend, and easy to explain.
Rather than focusing on automation or telemetry, this demo emphasizes engineering judgment and explainability. When multiple issues appear on the same device, the system correlates them using a simple protocol dependency model to infer a likely root cause. The goal is to show how network state analysis can be structured in a clean, maintainable, and operator-friendly way.
