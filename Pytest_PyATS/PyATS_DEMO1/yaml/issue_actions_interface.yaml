INTERFACE_DOWN:
  description: >
    Interface is operationally down based on device log evidence.
    This represents a resource-level failure that can impact
    higher-layer protocols.

  actions:
    - interface {interface}
    - no shutdown

  notes:
    - Issue is triggered only when the interface state is confirmed DOWN
    - Log events such as CRC errors or err-disable are treated as evidence
      and are not used as independent issue triggers
    - Multiple log messages may exist for the same interface before
      the final DOWN state is observed
