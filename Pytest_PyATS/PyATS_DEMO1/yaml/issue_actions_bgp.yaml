BGP_NEIGHBOR_DOWN:
  description: >
    BGP neighbor session is not established based on parsed
    control-plane state. This indicates an underlay routing
    connectivity issue.

  actions:
    - show bgp summary
    - show bgp neighbors {neighbor}

  notes:
    - Issue is triggered when BGP neighbor is not in Established state
    - YAML does not match log or CLI output directly
    - Neighbor state evaluation is handled by the semantic parser
